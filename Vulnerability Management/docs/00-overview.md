# Vulnerability management service

Nearly all clients have ongoing issues dealing with vulnerabilities in the enterprise. This includes 
detecting vulnerabilities, patching and remediating vulnerabilities, as well as prioritising which 
vulnerabilities need to be remediated before another.

Frameworks, such as the ASD's Essential Eight and ISO 27001, dictate that organisations must have a 
vulnerability management process in place and that vulnerabilities must be addressed. The Essential Eight,
for example, requires that if a public exploit exists the vulnerability must be patched within 48 hours 
of a vendor-supported remediation being released.

The larger the organisation, the more problematic vulnerability management becomes.

This service has been designed to analyse and review vulnerabilities within an organisation's Microsoft 
365 tenant, understand all vulnerabilities, enrich those vulnerabilities and then prioritise remediation.

The service does not manage the remediation. The outputs from the service are then handed to infrastructure 
and endpoint management teams for remediation.
